/**
 * ServiceWorker to handle caching.
 *
 * Currently this SW permanently caches the JS and HTML,
 * but doesn't try and persist any map data. This should
 * speed up the load on unreliable connections and allows
 * us to install as a PWA.
 *
 * serviceWorkerOption.assets is populated by the webpack
 * serviceworker plugin with all our local assets at the
 * top of this file, so any change in assets will result
 * in the bundle hash changing and a new SW being installed.
 *
 * Note that using ServiceWorkers in this way changes caching
 * semantics, and the updated JS doesn't come into effect until
 * the page is closed and reopened after the new SW is loaded.
